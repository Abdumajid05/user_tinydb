## 1.1 Overview

This project requires students to convert user data from a CSV file into a TinyDB database. Students will write a Python script to read the CSV file, process the data, and store it in TinyDB. The project aims to teach students about structured data processing, file I/O operations, and database interactions using TinyDB, a lightweight NoSQL database.
